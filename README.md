# 📌 Predicting Body Fat Percentage Using Machine Learning

## 1️⃣ Project Overview
This project utilizes the **Body Fat Prediction dataset** from Kaggle, which contains anthropometric measurements such as weight, height, waist circumference, and body fat percentage.

### 🔹 Business Objective
⚡ **Develop a machine learning model to predict body fat percentage** based on a person's physical measurements.

### 📌 Why is this important?
- **🏋️ Fitness & Health**: Personalized recommendations for diet and exercise.
- **🏥 Medical Diagnosis**: Assessment of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease risks.
- **🏆 Sports Industry**: Optimization of body composition for athletes.
- **💰 Insurance**: Health risk analysis for premium calculation.

## 3️⃣ Machine Learning Solution
💡 **Potential algorithms to use**:
- ✔️ **Linear Regression** (for interpretability)
- ✔️ **Random Forest** (for high accuracy)
- ✔️ **XGBoost** (for advanced optimization)
- ✔️ **Neural Networks** (for complex relationships)

### 🛠 **Model evaluation metrics**
- **📉 MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – Average absolute error.
- **📉 RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – Root mean square error.
- **📈 R² (R-squared)** – Measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.
